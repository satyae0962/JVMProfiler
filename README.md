# JVMProfiler
JVM Profiler to collect metrics.

Java Code to collect statistics at both process level and system level. 
Current code prints metrics on the console. 

Future plan :- Write multiple Reporters and Collect more statistics.
               Add more and more profilers to collect more detailed metrics.
               
Idea is to use this JVM Profiler to collect Spark-Streaming statistics.

TSDB -> InfluxDB
Monitoring Tool -> Graphana
